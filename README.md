Collection Data Structures for C
================================

Collection Data Structures for C is a library providing generic data
structures for managing collections of elements.

The API is designed to be somewhat similar to (Java's
Collections){http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html}
and implements a custom polymorphism scheme that decouples user code
from a specific collection implementation.
